## Playback Service
This service is a simple [Express](https://expressjs.com) server that serves the transcoded files produced by the [Media Transcoder](../media-transcoder).

## Configuration
This accepts/reads an `env` file with the following structure:

```env
PORT=3002
VIDEO_DIRECTORY=/path/to/resource/transcoded
```
 - `PORT` : port where the program should listen on.
 - `VIDEO_DIRECTORY` : should point to the `transcoded` directory generated by the media transcoding service in the `shared directory`.

For more details on the `shared directory`, [read here](../readme.md#shared-directory).
